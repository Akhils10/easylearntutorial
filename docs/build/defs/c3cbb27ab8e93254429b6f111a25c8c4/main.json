    "description": "Watch me practice programming apps from scratch live. Uncut, unedited, and raw. These videos include me trying to learn a new JavaScript framework or library, developing games, or mobile apps using HTML5 without any preparation whatsoever. The purpose of these tutorials is for me to share my learning experience with other programmers. If you have any suggestions about an MVC framework you think I should try, or any API or anything of the sort, please let me know. I'm very open minded, and don't mind recording my experience so others can learn from it, or perhaps just be entertained by common coding errors I may make along the way.",
