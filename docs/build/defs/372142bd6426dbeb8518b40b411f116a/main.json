  "description": "Join the challenge if you're a creative, skillful programmer wanting to have some fun, and hopefully learn something in the process. If you think you have the programming skills required to set a record in one of these programming challenges, you are welcome to join the challenge and try to prove yourself to the community! ============ Submit your best times by posting a comment in any one of the tutorial videos. ============ The computer programming challenge is something I made up just for fun. The point of the challenge is to see how fast a developer can program a particular piece of software. That's it. Of course, you can't use any code whatsoever that you have not written during the challenge. You cannot use any non-native libraries, and you cannot reuse code from a previous challenge. You may choose the technology to be used. That's it! The first challenge is to program a Tic Tac Toe game, which should be fully functional, and fun to play. My record is 33 minutes. The complete source code that accompanies these tutorials can be found at my GitHub repository at https:\/\/github.com\/formigone\/tictactoe-challenge",
