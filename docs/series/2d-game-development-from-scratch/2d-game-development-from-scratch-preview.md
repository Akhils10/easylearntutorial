                <h4>Published on Tuesday, August 12, 2014</h4>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Preview of my upcoming tutorial series about game development with JavaScript. The series will cover the theory and fundamentals of game programming, which is pretty language agnostic, although the implementation will be done in JavaScript and other web and HTML5 technologies.

You can buy my book "Learn HTML5 Through Game Development", from Amazon http://goo.gl/iZsdbi 

The tutorial series will teach game development in vanilla JavaScript using Google Closure tools (and AngularJs for tooling) using an iterative approach, as well as the entity/component architecture. We'll first write enough code to get a component working, then refactor into modular, reusable components. In the end, we'll build a small, but powerful game engine, and a full game using the engine.
