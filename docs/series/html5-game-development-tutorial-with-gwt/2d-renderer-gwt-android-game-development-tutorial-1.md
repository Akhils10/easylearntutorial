                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Learn how to develop 2D video games using Java. This series will use the Java language, and take advantage of such great tools as Google Web Toolkit (GWT) and the Android SDK, to teach you how to program 2D games to be played through an HTML5 compatible browser, or an Android device (phone or tablet). 

The series is aimed at both beginner and advanced programmers who love playing and making (or hoping to learn how to) computer games. Each lesson will build upon the next, so watching the tutorials in sequence is important. During the course of the tutorial lectures, we'll first build a framework to help us keep our code well organized and high quality, then we'll implement a few concrete games using the framework.

There will be tutorials where we'll discuss game development and design theory, followed by examples, UML diagrams to help you follow along, and the complete source code will be available in GitHub if you don't feel like typing everything from the videos.

Happy gaming!</p>
