                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The HTML structure for the tile map web app is done using Twitter Bootstrap, which is a "sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development". There are 3 sections and 4 widgets used in the app: the navigation menu, the tileset settings box, the tileset selector and viewer, and the map grid. 

One of the benefits of using AngularJS to build the single page app, even one that's a standalone piece as part of a JavaScript game engine, is that the UI (the application view) is very declarative. We can just hand out the responsibility of writing the HTML presentation layer to a web designer, and they can use whatever CSS framework they're already used to. In this case, I'm using one of the best CSS boilerplate frameworks of 2013: Twitter Bootstrap. What I love about bootstrap 2.3.2 is that it has tons of professional looking widgets and components. Their syntax and class structure is also very intuitive and easy to get used to. With that, I was able to set up the entire design of the tile map editor in a couple of minutes, without ever having to touch Adobe Photoshop, or any other designing software (not to mention that I was not willing to spend a lot of time doing graphics design for this simple tool).

Base description: Learn how to create 2D games using Angular.js and HTML5. The Tile-based map editor created in this tutorials is open-source, and is a built-in (but standalone) component of the RokkoJS game engine.
