                <h4>Published on Thursday, December 6, 2012</h4>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Google Web Toolkit tutorial: GWT is pronounced "gwit", rhyming with "quit". This video tutorial is a brief introduction to Google Web Toolkit, and to this web development series. The goal of GWT is to allow you to develop AJAX apps using the familiar Java language, with all its powerful tools, such as the Eclipse IDE, unit test suites, and all the years it's been available, and people have had a chance to master it. 

After the code base has been written in Java, the GWT compiler translates the code into highly optimized, browser specific Javascript, making development fast, maintenance manageable, and actual app execution a dreamy deal.

For more information about GWT, check out the official website at http://www.gwtproject.org/ where you'll find documentation, source code repository, issues list and information related to GWT roadmap and release. It is intended for developers interested in contributing to GWT, and for keeping people informed on new and upcoming changes to GWT, GWT related events and other news.

"GWT is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications. Its goal is to enable productive development of high-performance web applications without the developer having to be an expert in browser quirks, XMLHttpRequest, and JavaScript. GWT is used by many products at Google, including AdWords, AdSense, Flights, Hotel Finder, Offers, Wallet, Blogger. It's open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world."

"Productivity for developers, performance for users: GWT is a development toolkit for building and optimizing complex browser-based applications. GWT is used by many products at Google, including Google AdWords and Google Wallet. It's open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world."

"Writing web apps for multiple browsers can be a tedious and error-prone process. You can spend 90% of your time working around browser quirks. In addition, building, reusing, and maintaining large JavaScript code bases and AJAX components can be difficult and fragile."

"GWT (GWT) eases this burden by allowing developers to quickly build and maintain complex yet highly performant JavaScript front-end applications in the Java programming language."</p>
