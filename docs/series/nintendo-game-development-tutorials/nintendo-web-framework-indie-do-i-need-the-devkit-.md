                <h1>Nintendo Web Framework Indie: Do I Need the DevKit?</h1>
                <h4>Published on Saturday, February 15, 2014</h4>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Question: Can I develop my game for the Nintendo Wii U without a development kit?

Since I'm asked this question more than anything else regarding the Nintendo Web Framework, I've decided to make this video. Hopefully this helps you.

The short answer is: no - you don't need a devkit to write your game. The reason is because you're programming your game in HTML5 and JavaScript. Code and run your game on Google Chrome or Safari. Easy and simple.

However, you should buy the devkit so you can test your game in its native environment, test out the controllers, as well as other hardware specific to the Wii U. Not to mention that you'll need the hardware to "compile" your game, and put it in the store (Nintendo's eShop channel, where your game will be distributed).

Please don't ask me how much the devkit costs. If you're not in the program yet, go apply. Once you get accepted, you'll find out how much you'll need to pay for it, if you want to own one. However, for those who know how much this costs, and feel it's a bit high, here are five suggestions on how you can come up with that money:

1. Call Nintendo and tell them your situation. Maybe they will work with you.
2. Look for investors (family and friends, or other people that trust and believe in you)
3. Take a bank loan (or use credit cards). 
4. Crowd funding. Use Kickstarter or a similar service.
5. Make the commitment. Commit to coming up with the money no matter what, and just go for it.
